## The Correct, Full Workflow (The "Rinse and Repeat" Cycle)
Here is the complete cycle you and your teammates will follow for every new feature.

### Step 1: Get the Latest Code 🔄
Before you write a single line of new code, make sure you have the most recent version of the project.

# 1. Go to your main branch
    git checkout main

# 2. Pull all the latest changes from GitHub
    git pull origin main
### Step 2: Create a NEW Branch for Your NEW Task ✅
Now that main is up-to-date, create a fresh branch from it. Give it a descriptive name for the task you're about to do.


# Create and switch to a new branch in one command
    git checkout -b tahia-add-user-auth
(Good names: tahia-add-user-auth, frontend-fix-login-button, etc.)

### Step 3: Do Your Work
Now you're on your new, clean branch. Write your code, then add and commit your changes.
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: implement user registration endpoint"

### Step 4: Push Your NEW Branch and Make a Pull Request 🚀
Push your new branch to GitHub and merge it using a Pull Request, just like you did before.

    git push origin tahia-add-user-auth

Then go to GitHub, create the PR, and merge it into main.

You have now completed one full cycle. When you're ready to start the next feature, you go back to Step 1.

## What About the Old Branch? (Housekeeping 🧹)
After your pull request is merged, your old branch (backend_tahia or tahia-add-user-auth) has served its purpose. It's good practice to delete it to keep your repository clean.

GitHub usually shows a "Delete branch" button right after you merge a PR, which is the easiest way to do it.

You can also delete it from your local machine:

# Switch back to main first
    git checkout main

# Delete the old local branch
    git branch -d name-of-old-branch
