### Actions before hackathon
- Create branches for each person/feature, then merge to main once completed and tested.
- Boilerplate code - (Frontend - React+Vite setup, backend - server folder returns hello world)
- Commit to MVP 

Commit to the "MVP" (Minimum Viable Product):
- With only 3-5 hours, your goal is to build one core feature perfectly, not five features that are all broken.
- Once you have an idea, agree as a team: "What is the absolute minimum we need to build for this to work?"
- Everything else is a "stretch goal." The PM's job is to be ruthless and say "No, that's a stretch goal, let's focus on the MVP."

## ✨ What it Does

*In simple terms, explain what your application does.* What are the key features? 

-   **Feature 1:** [Briefly describe the main feature, e.g., "User account creation and login."]
-   **Feature 2:** [Briefly describe the next feature, e.g., "Real-time matching with other users based on course subjects."]
-   **Feature 3:** [And so on...]

## 🚀 How We Built It

Briefly describe your development process. What technologies did you use?

-   **Frontend:** [e.g., React, Vite, CSS, etc.]
-   **Backend:** [e.g., Node.js, Express, Python, Flask, etc.]
-   **Database:** [e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Firebase, etc.]
-   **APIs:** [e.g., Google Maps API, OpenAI API, etc.]
-   **Deployment:** [e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Google Cloud, etc.]
