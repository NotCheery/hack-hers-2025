# Clutch - 1st Place Win HackHers 2025

> ## Feminine help on standby!

Clutch was born from a familiar moment of panic on campus like needing an essential item, such as a tampon, painkiller, or heating pad, but having no way to get it quickly and conveniently.

We saw a clear gap in student support where these crucial wellness and hygiene items were inaccessible. We built Clutch to be a community-powered safety net, ensuring no student's success is compromised by a simple lack of access to personal care.
