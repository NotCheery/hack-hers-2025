Commit to the "MVP" (Minimum Viable Product):
- With only 3-5 hours, your goal is to build one core feature perfectly, not five features that are all broken.
- Once you have an idea, agree as a team: "What is the absolute minimum we need to build for this to work?"
- Everything else is a "stretch goal." The PM's job is to be ruthless and say "No, that's a stretch goal, let's focus on the MVP."
